# Search Algorithms
The goal for this project is to create search algorithms and know the time complexities of them.

### Project Concepts
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

### Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, â€¦ is forbidden.
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
- All your header files should be include guarded

### File Descriptions

| 1-binary.c | Searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary Search Algorithm |
| 2-O | Time complexity of worst case linear search in array of size n |
| 3-O | Space complexity of worst case iterative linear search algorithm in array of size n |
| 4-O | Time complexity of worst case of a binary search in array of size n |
| 5-O | Space complexity of worst case of a binary serach in array of size n |
| 6-O | Space complexity of given function/alogrithm |
