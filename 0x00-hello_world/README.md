# C - Hello, World
The goal for this project is to begin to learn C syntax and algorithms

### Project Concepts
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type gcc main.c
- What is an entry point
- What is main
- How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
- How to compile using gcc
- What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
- What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the main function influence the return value of the program

### Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4
- All your files should end with a new line
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use system
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

| 2-assembler | Generates assembly code and saves it to an output file |
| 3-name | Compiles C file and creates executable |
| 4-puts.c | Program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle |
| 5-printf.c | Program that prints line using printf |
| 6-size.c | Program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on |
