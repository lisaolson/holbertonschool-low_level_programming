# Binary Trees
The goal for this project is to gain familiarity with creating, using, and understanding binary trees.

### Project Goals
- Define a binary tree
- Define the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- Define the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- Define the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- Define the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- Define a complete, full, perfect, balanced binary tree
